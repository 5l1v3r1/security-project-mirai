# Security atack project: Mirai

__Mirai (未来)__ is malware designed for building large scale botnet of IoT devices. The bot and related programs was created by Anna-senpai, firstly discovered
and researched by MalwareMustDie in the end of August 2016. In reply to their blog post, one month later, Anna-sepai published sources and manual on how 
to build and run botnet. 

Original post ([reformated](post.md)) and sources [were uploaded to github by James Gallagher](https://github.com/James-Gallagher/Mirai.git). 
I have used this to research mirai and try it in lab environment as my university assignment on information security.

This repository features all necassary source code, configurations and scripts necessary to repeat my experiments. Also it has sources of my report that
describes everything in detail:

  * [Overview of cyberthreats](lab_report/background.md)
  * [Mirai botnet](lab_report/mirai.md)
  * [Performing atack](lab_report/atack.md)

_(These documents are written for pandoc with several extentions and unfortunately are not 100% compatible with github.)_
